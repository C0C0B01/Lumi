# **Response to [Wintry Forks statement](https://github.com/amsyarasyiq/wintry/commit/dcb2cd242dd0e6a36e796055c83fe186370143a5)

ive just gone ahead and removed all donation links from the project. when I added them I was under the impression wintry was not going to be receiving updates. as for features from development branches, the project is in a work in progress state and i also prefer everything to be bleeding edge so adding the features was a choice I made. I am open to discussion on the status of this project :)**

	  <b>Is Lumi a good replacement?</b>
  </summary>

Depends. If you value plugin stability over variety, Lumi may be a good replacement for you. Lumi is first-party focused, meaning there may be fewer plugins available compared to other client mods, but they will be more stable and reliable.
