# **Lumi**
A fork of Wintry

## Features
- Built-in plugins:
	- Experiments - you probably know what this is
	- ExpressionUtils - a.k.a. EmoteCloner
	- ChatBubbles - you never have seen this before
	- NoTrack - out-of-the-box
	- ...many more coming down the road!

## **Platform Support**
Lumi is built for and only supported on **Android*

## **Installation**
To install Lumi, a **loader** is required to inject and provide native functionality to Lumi. Lumi **only** supports loading from [**LumiXposed**](https://github.com/C0C0B01/LumiXposed) or [**WintryXposed**](https://github.com/wtcord/xposed).

## FAQs

	  <b>Is Lumi a good replacement?</b>
  </summary>

Depends. If you value plugin stability over variety, Lumi may be a good replacement for you. Lumi is first-party focused, meaning there may be fewer plugins available compared to other client mods, but they will be more stable and reliable.
